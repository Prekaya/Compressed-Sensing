%% Problem 1
for i = 1:numel(A_all)
    [~, error] = CompressedUtils.solveES(A_all{i}, y_all{i}, S);
    fprintf("Error for %s: %.4e\n", txt_all{i}, error)
end

%% Problem 2 
% Most of the elements of the Af matrix are mirrored with the exception of
% sign changes here and there.
% Ar array seems normal otherwise
% The error for the Af matrix ends up being much lower as a result of its
% redundancies
